While many computational kits and platforms have been developed in the past decades, most of the tangible kits that are designed for early childhood are either expensive to be deployed at home and in classroom environments or only provide pre-defined challenges with limited creative content creation opportunities. We investigated low-cost and expressive tangible interfaces that foster computational literacy. <br><br> Draw2Code is a paper-based tangible computational kit for young children to create an interactive 2D augmented reality animation. Children use Draw2Code to make their paper drawing alive as an animated virtual sprite and control it using hand gestures. Engaging with the kit, children can design, code, and play with their creations. It exposes children to basic programming concepts through playful and tangible interaction."
